# DUMP DATA IN JSON FILE USING PYTHON 
This repository is about adding data in a Json file using python in my 'to-do list' project.
Check if the Json file is empty, if yes then do nothing , if no then first write ',\n' to it and after then add the data in json file .
If there is something wrong in my code or in repository please comment . your comments will help me alot to improve my performance ðŸ¤—.
