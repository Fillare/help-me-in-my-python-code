# In this repository i want you to help me in my code
i am creating a to-do list project using only python code . i created a json file where the data will be stored. 
I want you to check if file is empty, if yes then do nothing , if no then write ',\n' to it and after then dump the data in json file .
If there is something wrong in my code or in repository please comment . your comments will help me alot to get better performance ðŸ¤—.
